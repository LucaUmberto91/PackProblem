# Problem Pack

## Problem Description
Imagine you're given a package in which you are to place a number of given items. The items each have a given weight (in kg) and a given price (in â‚¬). There's a total of `n` items. Each item has a unique ID, ranging from `1` to `n`.
In general, the package will not be able to hold all of the given items. The reason is that there's a maxium weight the package can hold. It can only hold the items you place in the package if their total weight doesn't exceed this maximum weight.
It is now your job to pick a subset of the given items so that their total price is maximized and their combined weight doesn't exceed the maximum weight the package can hold.
